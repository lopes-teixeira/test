 <h1> The concept </h1>
<body> 
<p> Everyone has played fighting games, from street fighter on a bar, or mortal kombat on a console, but let´s start from the beggining, so what defines a fighiting game?
well, a fighting game it´s a game where you and your opponent have a bar of health, and when you strike your opponent with a MOVE, the bar decreases,and the player who loses all of his health first loses.</p>
<h2> Frame data, hurtbox and hitbox </h2>
<p> This is where it gets interesting, you problably you didn´t know but there are games out there like mortal kombat 11 that make people compete for a hundred thousand dollars, for a game match, and they win by studying this aspect, the frame data.
 a frame is a 60th of a second, and this whole matches are decided by that. what frame data does is basically inform the player how slow or fast his move is, per example if you press square in your control with scorpion, and subzero at the same exact time, sub zero wil hit scorpion, because his move is faster by that 60th of frame.
Also, that frame aspect is used to to "punish" your opponent when he´s to "negative"
example: if you do a certain move with scorpion, it takes 20 frames for the character to recover,(-20) and in that recovery time, where you can´t block for a third of a second, is when you get pusinhed by your opponent. </p>

This squares around the character, are his hitboxes, and hurtboxes.
a hitbox, it´s a limited space that defines if a move will hit or miss, and the hurtbox, is the limited space where your disjointed hitbox strike the opponent, since that´s pretty confusing, i´ll show you this clip:

<p> A combo is a sequece of moves, a combination, that you have to do for bigger damage, the more hits your combo does, the more damage you do. </p>
<h4> Chain and Link Combos </h4>
<p> There are two types of combos, the chain combos, which you pres a determined sequence of buttons and the character does the combo: </p> <img src="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/ActiveWideGuernseycow-max-1mb.gif">
<p> And the link combos, where you: have to time your hits, so the combo can happen: </p> <img src="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/ExcellentDismalDarklingbeetle-max-1mb.gif">
