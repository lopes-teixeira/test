<p> Everyone has played fighting games, from street fighter on a bar, or mortal kombat on a console, but let´s start from the beggining, so what defines a fighiting game?
well, a fighting game it´s a game where you and your opponent have a bar of health, and when you strike your opponent with a MOVE, the bar decreases,and the player who loses all of his health first loses.</p>
<h2> Frame data, hurtbox and hitbox </h2>
<p> This is where it gets interesting, you problably you didn´t know but there are games out there like mortal kombat 11 that make people compete for a hundred thousand dollars, for a game match, and they win by studying this aspect, the frame data.a frame is a 60th of a second, and this whole matches are decided by that. what frame data does is basically inform the player how slow or fast his move is, per example if you press square in your control with scorpion, and subzero at the same exact time, sub zero wil hit scorpion, because his move is faster by that 60th of frame.
